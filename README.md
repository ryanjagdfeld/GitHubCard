# GitHubCard
A simple module extension to display [GitHub Cards](https://github.com/lepture/github-cards) for [Oqtane](https://github.com/oqtane/oqtane.framework).

To install simply download the nuget package from the current release and upload it in the Modules admin page of your Oqtane instance.  If you are building the package on in your development enviornment, it can be found in the Packages folder after building in release.  You can also download the package from the releases here on GitHub.

Once installed, add the module to a page.  Click on Add GitHubCard and enter the username or the username/repo you would like for the card to display.  Choose a theme and select save.  You can add as many cards as you'd like.
